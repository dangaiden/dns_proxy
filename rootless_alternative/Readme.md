## DNS-proxy project (rootless)

NOTE: The main difference with the root "main" project is that this will run in port 5300 instead of on a lower port than 1024 (DNS port: 53), therefore, queries with nslookup or using a web browser won't work as it does by default in the other project.

**This solution won't work out of the box** by only changing the name server of the client to the DNS proxy IP address as the port where the container will run is 5300.

---

### Summary

This project aims to provide the functionality of a DNS proxy over TLS.

It aims to be used as a micro-service (within a container) so you can specify an IP address (called using -e when running the container with Docker) that will **listen on port 5300**, therefore, DNS requests sent to that IP address will be handled by the DNS proxy.

The proxy reads the query sent via UDP, creates an encrypted connection with an upstream server (Cloudflare) over TCP(TLS) and handles back the response to the client.

It requires the [dnspython](https://www.dnspython.org/) library, as it will handle all the binary data from the requests and replies, otherwise, you will have to manage the raw data from the client and the upstream server.


### Running the project in a container

- Create a network to avoid problems within your own LAN. Therefore
you should create a new docker network by executing (or use one you already have):

```
docker network create --subnet 192.168.10.0/24 dns_network
```

- Proceed to create the docker image by using the Dockerfile provided by running:
```
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```
Example:
```
docker build -t dns_srv_proxy_rootless .
```

- Run the container in detached mode within the docker network created previously:

```
docker run --name <your-container-name> -e DNS_PROXY_IP=<your-IP-address> -d --net <your-docker-network> <your-image-name>
```

Example:
```
docker run --name proxy_dns -e DNS_PROXY_IP=192.168.10.2 -d --net dns_network dns_srv_proxy_rootless
```

- To test it you can do it in different ways:

You can try using the IP address of the DNS proxy as your DNS/Nameserver and port 5300 (if you can) or use *dig* pointing to the port 5300.

Â· Tested it with the following tools: nslookup

Some examples:

## Possible improvements

- Control error of queries/messages (RCODE for example)
- Add TCP connectivity between client and proxy.
- Add caching to gain performance in repetitive queries.
